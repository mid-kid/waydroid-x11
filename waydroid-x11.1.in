.TH WAYDROID-X11 "1" "June 2025" "@PACKAGE_NAME@ @PACKAGE_VERSION@"
.SH NAME
waydroid-x11 - Launch a Waydroid session in X11
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B waydroid-x11
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Helper script to launch Waydroid within a Weston compositor, running inside an X11 session. This is useful when Waydroid itself doesn't support it at this time.

Additional options can be given to the script, which will be passed to the weston compositor. As such, one can execute:

.in +8n
waydroid-x11 --width=720 --height=1080
.in

To change the resolution of the compositor. See
.BR weston (1)
for more information.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The weston compositor can be configured through
.BR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/waydroid-x11.ini .
As such, an example file to set the resolution would look like this:

.in +8n
.EX
[output]
name=X1
mode=720x1080
.EE
.in

See
.BR weston.ini (5)
for more information.
.SH BUGS
Resizing the Weston window will crash Waydroid. While it may boot up again automatically, this isn't reliable.

A 2 second delay is added between opening Weston and launching Waydroid. This allows someone to maximize the window before Waydroid launches.
