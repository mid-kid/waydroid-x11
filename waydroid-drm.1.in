.TH WAYDROID-DRM "1" "June 2025" "@PACKAGE_NAME@ @PACKAGE_VERSION@"
.SH NAME
waydroid-drm - Launch a standalone Waydroid session
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B waydroid-drm
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Helper script to launch Waydroid within a Weston compositor, running standalone. This allows you to log into an Android session, as if it were the running operating system. Unlike
.BR waydroid-x11 ,
this supports better multitouch and gestures.

You can launch it as
.B waydroid-drm
from within a console, or from a Display/Login Manager, such as SDDM.

Press CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE to close the session.
.SH CONFIGURATION
The weston compositor can be configured through
.BR $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/waydroid-drm.ini .
This file follows the same syntax as
.BR weston.ini (5).
.SH BUGS
Setting up audio requires a pulseaudio server to be available. Its availability is verified by using the
.B pacmd info
command. If it's not available (e.g. set up by an init system), the script will attempt to start one, using pipewire(-pulse) if available, otherwise with pulseaudio.

If you get no audio, the audio server chosen may have its primary output muted. Try setting it up first.

If the audio server isn't available, and the script has failed to launch one, the Waydroid window may never launch.

When a system has multiple monitors, Waydroid will only be launched on one of them.
